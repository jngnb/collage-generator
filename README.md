# CollageGenerator
### Summary
_A state-of-the-art playlist cover generator for Spotify playlists_
Takes a Spotify playlist ID as input, compiles album covers of all the tracks in the playlist, removes the background of all covers, puts edited album covers into a collage under an algorithm to prevent too much overlap.
### Intent
The Spotify app automatically creates a 4-frame playlist cover from the first 4 tracks of a playlist. 
I wanted to write a program that creates a playlist cover that gives a better sense of the playlist content _and_ looks more artistic
